PART 1, STRATEGY OUTPUT
(Claude must generate a complete strategy before continuing to the media plan.)
1. Campaign Overview
Provide a concise strategic interpretation of the brief:
 • Core objective
 • High-level audience description
 • High-level programme description
 • Key markets
 • Campaign mode: Budget-Driven or KPI-Driven
 Explain how the mode influences strategic direction.
 Do not repeat the brief text or include numeric KPIs.
2. Audience Segmentation and Personas
Segmentation rules:
 • Use one segment if differences are minimal.
 • Only segment when behaviour, motivations, or intent differ meaningfully.
For each valid segment include:
 • Demographics
 • Professional context
 • Motivations
 • Pain points
 • Decision barriers
 • Intent behaviours
 • Messaging triggers
3. Recommended Channel Mix
List channels without ranking or qualifiers.
For each channel include only:
 • Strategic role
 • Why it fits the audience’s behaviour
Do not list tactics or formats.
4. Conversion Funnel Architecture
Use the funnel: Prospecting → Retargeting → Nurturing
For EACH stage, you must output exactly one CTA.
This CTA must:
• Be the single best next-step action for that stage
• Be consistent with the brief, the programme, and audience maturity
• Flow logically into the next funnel stage
• Become the single source of truth for Landing Page actions and Campaign Flow
• Appear consistently across Strategy, Campaign Flow, Media Plan, and Ads Specs
For each stage output:
• Stage objective
• Mindset + psychological shift
• One CTA only (mandatory)
• KPI type (Traffic, MQL, SQL, Application, etc.)
• Campaign type (Prospecting / Retargeting / Nurturing)
Rules:
• No multiple CTAs per stage.
• No conflicting CTAs across stages.
• Nurturing CTA must be the highest-intent conversion.
5. Messaging Structure
Umbrella Messaging
Provide one campaign-wide human truth.
Prospecting Messaging
Provide 2 aspirational topline messages per segment.
 Identity-driven, ambition-driven, future-oriented.
 Example style (not to be copied):
 • “Lead in a complex, interconnected world.”
 • “Turn uncertainty into strategic advantage.”
Retargeting Messaging
Provide 1 programme-specific hook message.
Example style:
 • “Cambridge strategic frameworks and a global executive cohort that accelerates real leadership outcomes.”
Nurturing Messaging
Provide 1 urgent, action-focused message.
Example style:
 • “Seats are filling fast—secure your place in the next intake.”
Messages must be directional, not full copy.
6. Campaign Flow
Layer 1 — Tactic Listing
Strict rules:
 • Bullet lists only
 • No sentences
 • No explanations
 • No commentary
 • No qualifiers
 • No numeric KPIs
 • No timeline or pacing
 • Format: Channel: Tactic Name
 • Fully original content
 • Only use tactics from tactic_library.csv
Prospecting
Channel: Tactic Name
Channel: Tactic Name
Channel: Tactic Name
Retargeting
Channel: Tactic Name
Channel: Tactic Name
Channel: Tactic Name
Nurturing
Channel: Tactic Name
Channel: Tactic Name
Channel: Tactic Name
Layer 2 — REAL CAMPAIGN FLOW (MANDATORY)
After the tactic list, produce a structured text flow showing how users actually move through the funnel, aligned to the single CTA per stage defined in the Conversion Funnel Architecture.
Rules:
Prospecting drives to the Prospecting CTA
Usually: Prospecting → Landing Page → [Prospecting CTA]
Landing Page actions must ONLY include CTAs defined in the funnel
No extra or conflicting actions.
Retargeting must recover drop-offs toward the Retargeting CTA
• Lead Gen Ads → capture lead
• Traffic/Display Ads → return to Landing Page → Retargeting CTA

Nurturing pushes ONLY to the Nurturing CTA
Example: Apply Now / Speak to Advisor / Enrol Now (depending on brief)

Flow must represent actual movement:
• Prospecting → Landing Page
• Landing Page → Action or Drop-off
• Drop-off → Retargeting
• Retargeting → Retargeting CTA
• Retargeting CTA → Nurturing
• Nurturing → Nurturing CTA
• If relevant → Admissions / Sales Team handoff

Format:
• Hierarchical bullets
• No paragraphs
• No long sentences
• No filler
• No numbers
• Fully original and brief-driven

Example style (do NOT copy content):
Prospecting → Landing Page
• User hits Landing Page
• User can:
– [Prospecting CTA only]
– Drop Off

Retargeting Layer
• Drop-offs recaptured via:
– [Retargeting CTA only]

Nurturing Layer
• Warm leads pushed toward:
– [Nurturing CTA only]

Admissions / Sales Handoff (if relevant)
• Leads from Nurturing CTA routed to admissions or sales

PART 2, MEDIA PLAN OUTPUT
(Claude must generate the media plan immediately after the strategy.)
Use:
 • Strategy Campaign Flow
 • brief.txt
 • tactic_library.csv
 • benchmark.csv
 • country_tier.csv
 • media_plan.csv
1. Campaign Mode
Determine Budget-Driven or KPI-Driven strictly from brief.txt.
2. Tactic Review
Use all tactics from the Strategy Campaign Flow in this order:
Prospecting → Retargeting → Nurturing
3. Tactic Column Rule (Strict)
The Tactic column must contain only the tactic_name, modified as follows:
• If the tactic’s channel is not Email → append “ Ad”
 Examples:
 • LinkedIn Traffic Ad
 • Meta Lead Gen Ad
 • Google Search Ad
 • Google Display Ad
• If the tactic’s channel is Email → keep the name unchanged
 Example:
 • Nurture Email
Do not include funnel stage, channel prefix, format prefix, or any additional text.
4. Media Plan Logic
Load Campaign Flow tactics.


Map markets to tiers using country_tier.csv.


Build one unified blended-market plan.


For each tactic_name, match benchmark.csv exactly and extract:
 • CTR
 • CPC
 • Conversion Rate 1
 • Conversion Rate 2


Allocate budget:
 • Budget-Driven → distribute total budget
 • KPI-Driven → refine until KPI is within ±10%


Forecast calculations:
 • Clicks = Budget / CPC
 • Impressions = Clicks / CTR
 • Leads = Clicks * CR1
 • Acquisitions = Leads * CR2
 • CPA = Budget / Acquisitions
 • CPL = Budget / Leads


Compare CPA/CPL vs benchmarks and adjust if needed.


Conversion rates must not appear in the table.
5. OUTPUT FORMAT - MEDIA PLAN
Output only the media plan table, following the exact structure and column order in media_plan.csv.
Apply these rules:
Funnel Column
Use only: Prospecting, Retargeting, Nurturing.
Tactic Column
Follow the Ad-suffix rule above.
 It must contain only the tactic_name.
Budget Allocation %
Budget Allocation % = Tactic Budget / Total Budget
Total Row
Populate with:
 • Total Budget
 • Total Impressions
 • Total Clicks
 • Weighted CTR
 • Weighted CPC
 • Total Leads
 • Total Acquisitions
 • Overall CPA
 • Overall CPL
Output Requirement
Output must be a clean, Google-Sheet-ready table with no commentary.

PART 3, FINAL INSTRUCTION
Produce BOTH:
 • The complete Strategy (Part 1)
 • The complete Media Plan (Part 2)
Revision logic:
 • “Revise the strategy” → regenerate Strategy AND Media Plan
 • “Revise the media plan” → regenerate ONLY the Media Plan using the same Strategy
Now generate the full combined output.
