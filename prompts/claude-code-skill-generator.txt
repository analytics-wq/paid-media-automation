You are acting as a senior software engineer AND prompt architect for my paid media automation project.

CONTEXT
I have a GitHub repository called `paid-media-automation`. It already contains:

/schema
- brief.txt
- tactic_library.csv
- benchmark.csv
- country_tier.csv
- media_plan.csv

/ads-production-template
- linkedin_ads_production.csv
- meta_ads_production.csv
- google_ads_production.csv

At the repo root (or within a subfolder) there are also two prompt files:
- media-strategy-prompt.txt  → this is the current mega prompt for Strategy + Media Plan
- ads-production-prompt.txt → this is the current mega prompt for Ads Production Specs

I also already have a Claude Skill called `paid-media-strategist-construct`, but I now want to UPGRADE it so that:
- All the logic in media-strategy-prompt.txt and ads-production-prompt.txt is embedded directly into Skill.md.
- Once the Skill is installed, I do NOT need to paste those prompts anymore.
- In a normal chat with this Skill, I can just say things like:
  - “Run the full workflow for the latest brief.”
  - “Generate only the media plan.”
  - “Generate only the ads specs based on the latest approved media plan.”
And Claude should know exactly what to do, because the workflows are defined inside the Skill.

GOAL
Your job is to:
1) Inspect the repo and the two prompt files.
2) Design a NEW, clean Skill.md that:
   - Keeps the existing identity of `paid-media-strategist-construct`.
   - Integrates the logic from media-strategy-prompt.txt (Strategy + Media Plan).
   - Integrates the logic from ads-production-prompt.txt (Ads Specs).
   - Defines explicit workflows and usage patterns so I only give short commands in chat.
3) Output:
   - A complete Skill.md file (YAML) ready to be zipped and uploaded to Claude.
   - A short README-style usage guide explaining how my team should talk to this Skill.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES
- Do NOT copy the prompt files blindly; instead, refactor and compress them into:
  - identity / style
  - data sources (brief, tactics, benchmarks, media_plan, ads templates)
  - clearly named workflows (Strategy, Media Plan, Ads Production)
  - revision logic (“revise strategy”, “revise media plan”, “revise ads specs”)
- The Skill instructions should be GENERAL, not hard-coded to NUS or any specific client.
- The Skill must assume that:
  - brief.txt always contains the current campaign brief.
  - All CSVs are up to date.
  - media-strategy-prompt.txt and ads-production-prompt.txt are now SOURCES for the Skill design, not something the user will paste in the future.

WORKFLOW BEHAVIOUR INSIDE THE SKILL
Design the Skill so that it responds to these patterns:

1) “Run full workflow”
   - Reads brief.txt + all schema files.
   - Generates:
     - Strategy (campaign overview, audience, channel mix, funnel, messaging, campaign flow)
     - Media Plan (table matching media_plan.csv structure).
   - Optionally, if the user says “include ad specs” → also run Ads Production.

2) “Strategy only”
   - Only run the strategy workflow using brief.txt + tactic_library.csv.
   - Do not generate media plan or ads specs.

3) “Media plan only”
   - Assume the latest Strategy has already been produced in this chat.
   - Use the Campaign Flow + all schema files to generate ONLY the media plan table.

4) “Ads specs only”
   - Assume the latest media plan table was already produced in this chat.
   - Use ads-production-template CSVs to generate the ads specs.

5) Revision logic
   - “Revise the strategy” → regenerate Strategy and then regenerate Media Plan (and ads specs if previously requested).
   - “Revise the media plan” → keep current Strategy; recalculate Media Plan only.
   - “Revise the ads specs” → keep Strategy + Media Plan; regenerate ads specs only.

TASK PHASES
Please work in clear phases:

Phase 1 – Repo + prompt inspection
- Locate:
  - media-strategy-prompt.txt
  - ads-production-prompt.txt
  - current Skill (if present)
- Summarise the key logic and sections in both prompt files.
- Summarise how they map to:
  - Strategy workflow
  - Media Plan workflow
  - Ads Production workflow

Phase 2 – Skill.md design
- Propose the top-level structure of the new Skill.md:
  - name, description
  - high-level identity / style rules
  - data sources section (brief.txt, tactic_library.csv, benchmark.csv, country_tier.csv, media_plan.csv, ads-production templates)
  - “Core Workflows” section that encodes:
    - Strategy Output
    - Media Plan Output
    - Ads Production Output
    - Revision behaviour
- Wait for my approval before writing the final Skill.md.

Phase 3 – Implement Skill.md
- Write the FULL YAML Skill.md, incorporating:
  - The existing `paid-media-strategist-construct` role definition
  - Refactored logic from media-strategy-prompt.txt
  - Refactored logic from ads-production-prompt.txt
- Make sure indentation and YAML formatting are valid.

Phase 4 – Usage Guide
- Provide a short usage guide text that I can paste into README.md explaining:
  - What the Skill does
  - What files it relies on
  - Example commands:
    - “Run full workflow”
    - “Strategy only for this brief”
    - “Generate only media plan”
    - “Generate ads specs only”

Now start with Phase 1: inspect the repo and both prompt files, summarise what you find, and propose a Skill.md structure before writing any YAML.
